        <h3>Why we Do this!!</h3>
        <p>Homeless people are often dehumanized by traumas, addictions, circumstances and the fears of others. But they are people just like you and me, deserving of kindness and compassion. The simplest and most impactful way to help a homeless person is to make them feel seen, loved and worthwhile. It can be as easy as smiling, making eye contact, shaking someoneâ€™s hand or calling them by name. We are all unique humans with complex stories. We are all sometimes in need of grace and a helping hand.</p>
